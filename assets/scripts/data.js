        course_overview: "Welcome to 'Introduction to Computer Systems' — your gateway to understanding what truly happens behind the scenes in a computer. This course lays the foundation for core computing knowledge by bridging the gap between high-level programming and low-level machine behavior. You'll dive into how computers execute code, manage memory, and process instructions — while simultaneously building strong fundamentals in C programming. Topics like number systems, binary logic, memory models, and instruction cycles will be explored through visual explanations and real coding practice. By the end of the course, you'll not only know how to write programs — you'll understand how your code interacts with the hardware. This knowledge is crucial for systems programming, embedded systems, and building a deeper engineering mindset.",
