I've walked the same hallways, stressed over the same exams, and yes, screamed internally during project weeks. But through it all, I found my passion: helping others learn, laugh, and level up. Whether it's OOP, Data Structures, or debugging your late-night code crisis; I've got your back. Let's turn stress into success and make learning a vibe, not a chore!",
